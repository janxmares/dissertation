\chapter{Content of Enclosed DVD}

This is optional: you may enclose a DVD to this thesis which contains empirical data and MatLab/R/Stata source codes. Even better so, you can create a special website for your project. Stating in your thesis that the data and source codes are available upon request is enough but please, have them prepared for such requests.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Folder 1: Source codes
    \item Folder 2: Empirical data
\end{itemize}
